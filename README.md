Hi there! 👋 I'm Samuel. I'm an experienced Engineer, Developer, and cybersecurity enthusiast with expertise in areas such as DL, data privacy, reverse engineering, software, web, and API development.

I have a solid foundation with a Bachelor’s in Information Technology from Arcada University of Applied Sciences and an ongoing M.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Åbo Akademi. My interests, academic experiences, and professional experiences combine to cover a wide area of the tech industry.

Some of my other expertise includes technical support, reverse engineering, CMS, app, and API development. This is underpinned by a proficiency in Ruby, JavaScript, C#, React, and a deep understanding of PHP, C, Python, WordPress, and TypeScript.
